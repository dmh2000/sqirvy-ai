in directory web/query, create a web app and an associated web server that allows users to query a language model using a prompt. there whould be three endpoints: "anthropic", "openai", and "gemini". the anthropic endpoint should use the claude-3-sonnet-20240229 model, the openai endpoint should use the gpt-4-turbo-preview model, and the gemini endpoint should use the gemini-2.0-flash-exp model. the web app should have a form that allows users to enter a prompt and submit it to the appropriate endpoint. the web app should display the response from the language model. the web server should serve static files from the static directory and handle api requests for the anthropic, openai, and gemini endpoints. the server should listen on port 8080 and log messages to the console.
