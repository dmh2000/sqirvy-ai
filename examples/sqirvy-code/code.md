# what to do
- generate code for the design specification
- output only the code, no comments or annotations. 
- do not wrap the output with triple backticks

# the code should have these properties if they apply for the design specification
- Readability: The code should be easy to understand and follow, using clear naming conventions, proper indentation, and self-explanatory structure.
- Reliability: The program should consistently produce correct results and function as intended without crashing or malfunctioning.
- Maintainability: The code should be easy to modify, update, and fix, allowing for future improvements and adaptations.
- Efficiency: Good code optimizes resource usage, including processor time, memory, and other system resources.
- Portability: The program should be able to run on different hardware and operating system platforms with minimal modifications.
- Robustness: The code should anticipate and handle potential errors, unexpected inputs, and resource unavailability.
- Usability: The program should be user-friendly and intuitive for its intended purpose12.
- Testability: The code should be structured in a way that facilitates thorough testing and verification of its functionality.
- Security: Good code incorporate measures to protect against unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities.
- Scalability: The program should be able to handle increasing amounts of data and traffic without significant performance degradation.
- Consistency: The code should maintain a uniform style and structure throughout the project, making it easier for multiple developers to work on it.
